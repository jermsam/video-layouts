## Auto Layout
Basic Video Layout for all conferencing apps 

## Requirements
- maintain aspect ratio
- Screen  only changes responsively
- It's the tile size that adjusts as we increase their count

## Problems 
1.  CSS3 Grid, does not respect the aspect ratio of the tiles
2.  Flex, does not cover defined surfaces.
